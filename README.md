### Drawing corners in an image of a chessboard pattern.

Using the OpenCV functions findChessboardCorners() and drawChessboardCorners() to automatically find and draw corners in an image of a chessboard pattern. Corners are only points where two black and two white squares intersect, in other words, only counting inside corners, not outside corners.
